hello, myself rudrakshi sharma and i am from the land of kings that is rajasthan rajasthan , located in the northwestern part of India, is known for its rich cultural heritage, royal history, and stunning landscapes. Famous for its vibrant festivals, majestic palaces, and historic forts, The state is also renowned for its traditional arts, cuisine, and the vast Thar Desert. Major cities include Jaipur, Udaipur, and Jodhpur. so, for now let it be side for some time and coming on the center point of this paragraph that's me. i rudrakshi i'm currently a 1st sem student at shri jain pg colleage bikaner. i complete my schooling from k.v no. 1 bikaner i am not a very bright student but not a slow learner too. i am falling under the category of above average student. Outside of academics i am intested to in things like modeling, clicking photo's etc. except these i try things like basketball, drama, dance. i am not a introvert kind of person, i am a ambivert.that means a person who is neither strictly an introvert nor an extrovert. if i am not going to choose this path of computer science . in that case i sure go to give interveiws in any of the airlines after turning 18 to become a cabin crew,or maybe i like to go with some technology related works. so that all about me in short, thank you.
